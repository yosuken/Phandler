### Phandler ver 0.1.0 (2024-08-22) ###

[description]
Phandler - protein family alignments hundler.
Phandler receives multiple MSAs of protein families, and ...
(1) builds HMM DBs for HMMER and HHblits
(2) generates position converter of included proteins, alignments, HMMER hmms, and HH-suite hmms
(3) inspects each MSA by making a weblogo and similarity-based heatmap

[usage]
$ Phandler [options] -i <input MSA files> -o <output dir>

[dependencies]
- ruby (ver >= 3.0)
- GNU parallel

[options]
  (general)
    -h, --help
    -v, --version

  (file/directory)
    -i, --input      [file(s)] (required)  -- protein MSA file(s) (nucleotide or protein, the type is automatically detected)
                                              Multiple genome files can be specfied with wildcard (e.g., 'dir/*.fa', quote required) or comma separated values without space (e.g., A.fa,B.fa).
                                              File names should be unique (used as output labels).
    -o, --outdir     [path] (required)     -- output directory (should not exist unless '--overwrite' is specified)
    --overwrite             (default: off) -- overwrite output directory

  (hhblits)
    -e, --evalue     [num] (default: 1e-5) -- evalue threshold of hmmsearch
        --iter       [num] (default: 2)    -- number of iteration for hhblits

  (computation)
    -n, --ncpus      [int] (default: 1)    -- num CPUs to use
